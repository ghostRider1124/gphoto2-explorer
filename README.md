# gphoto2 Photo Explorer

This utility will sync with any gphoto2 compatible camera using USB
and create a web interface which categorizes photos into a calendar
based on available EXIF data.

## Installation

```
git clone git://github.com/zeller/gphoto2-explorer.git /var/www/gphoto2-explorer
```

For convience, an installation script is provided for easily
installing required module on Debian based systems.

This system has been tested on both Raspbian and Ubuntu 12.04.

* `scripts/install-base-modules.sh`: Installs the packages needed for
  the DSLR USB interface, post-processing of photos, and the web
  server.

## Using

* `scripts/sync.sh`: Downloads all of the most recently taken photos
  of off the DSLR and into the `photos` directory and `thumbs`
  directory, extracting EXIF data into a sqlite database.

Visit http://localhost/gphoto2-explorer/album/ to view your photos in
calendar format. The number of photos taken on each day will be
displayed as a clickable link with a link to a thumbnail based view of
all photos taken on that day, with originals obtainable by clicking on
any thumbnail.

It may be useful to install the following extra packages if you plan
to work on the codebase.

apt-get install emacs
